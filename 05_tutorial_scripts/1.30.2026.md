Week 2. Tutorial

Set Up
During our **Friday tutorial time only**, we can use this node by first running the following command( when at home, skip this step):
```
sinteractive --reservation=aneq505 --time=01:00:00 --partition=amilan --nodes=1 --ntasks=2 --qos=normal
```

Tutorial
1 Make a new directory for the analysis:
```
# replace "username" with YOUR CSU EID   
cd /scratch/alpine/username@colostate.edu  
  
# make a directory using the mkdir command
mkdir decomp_tutorial  
  
# move into that directory using cd
cd decomp_tutorial

# replace "username" with YOUR CSU EID
cd /scratch/alpine/username@colostate.edu 
  
# make a directory using the mkdir command   
mkdir decomp_tutorial  
  
# move into that directory using cd
cd decomp_tutorial
```

2 Import Decomp Tutorial Metadata and turn "on" qiime2
```
# we first purge any loaded modules from the node we are on, this ensures no conflicting modules are "on"   

# modules are preloaded packages of things people commonly use  
module purge   
  
# we can turn "on" or "load" qiime2  
module load qiime2/2024.10_amplicon

# Copy the metadata from the decomp project into a new metadata folder:

# make a directory for the metadata using the mkdir command while you are INSIDE of the decomp_tutorial directory
mkdir metadata 

# move into that directory using cd   
cd metadata

# Now, we will use `cp` command (this is a new one! this stand for "copy") to download the metadata for this study: * don't forget that period at the end!

cp/pl/active/courses/2025_summer/CSU_2025/q2_workshop_final/QIIME2/metadata_q2_workshop.txt .

# Rename the metadata using the  `mv`  (move) command
mv metadata_q2_workshop.txt metadata.txt

# Visualize the metadata file
qiime metadata tabulate \--m-input-file metadata.txt \--o-visualization metadata.qzv

```

3 To look at this, **transfer the file metadata.qzv from alpine to your local computer using OnDemand** and go to [view.qiime2.orgLinks to an external site.](http://view.qiime2.org/ "(opens in a new window)"). Take some mental notes about the kinds of variables you see - _why do you think they will be important for this study?_
