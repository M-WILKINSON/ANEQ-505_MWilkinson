1. Olm, et al. Figure 3b:
Figure 3B shows the percentage of microbial strains detected in mothers and infants that are found only in infants (yellow), only in mothers (green), or shared within mother–infant dyads (pink), and they are grouped by bacterial phylum.  

The figure was generated using the sequenced fecal sample data from both the infants and their mothers, which allows the researchers to identify microbes at the strain level and detect whether vertical transmission occurs. 

The main result of this figure is that some microbial strains are shared between mothers and infants, indicating some vertical transmission, however, several strains are not shared. The amount of strain sharing also differs across bacterial phyla, suggesting that vertical transmission is taxon-specific rather than uniform across the entire gut microbiome. 

In the context of the paper’s results, this figure shows that maternal transmission contributes to infant microbiome assembly but does not fully/definitively determine it. Infants must also acquire microbes from their environment. This figure is needed/helpful because it provides strain-level evidence about how the infant microbiome is assembled, helping the authors move beyond just describing microbiome differences across lifestyles to more clearly understanding the mechanisms of microbiome assembly. 

These findings may guide future researchers in refining questionnaires to identify at-risk workers and inform targeted interventions to enhance occupational health.
