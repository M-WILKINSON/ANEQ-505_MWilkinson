Step 1. Logged into Alpine via OnDemand and created a new directory called "cow" using the new directory button. 

Step 2. Clicked on "open in terminal", so it was already in the correct cow directory but if I was in another instance/terminal I would use the following command to change directories:
```
cd /scratch/alpine/c832787271@colostate.edu/cow
```
